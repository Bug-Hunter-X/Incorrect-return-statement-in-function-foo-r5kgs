# Incorrect return statement in function foo

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions where an incorrect return statement causes unexpected behavior.

The function `foo` is intended to return the sum of two numbers, `a` and `b`. However, it incorrectly returns 0 if either `a` or `b` is 0.

The solution demonstrates how to correct the function to return the expected sum in all cases.
